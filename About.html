									<h1>My Story</h1>
									<p> It has taken many attempts to learn how to code. With many failures and setbacks. Every time I gave up, I just had to give it one more try. One more time to make something work. The challenge is the reason I enjoy coding.</p>
									<p> The daunting path of self-taught programmer and choosing to go down this route has given me new ways to think differently and it has the most amazing community I've experienced.</p>
									<p>It has truly taken a Passion to start learning something new. With every time I've fallen, it has taken Grit to back up. To push toward my goals has taken all my Determination to achieve them.</p>
									<p>Now looking back at all the work I've done to this point. I now realize that it was so easy to just give up, But by just taking one more small step, even one more line of code each day. To keep coming back after quitting for whatever reason. It all comes together to be this massive achievement and say I did that.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Main Pic.JPG" alt="Joseph Hughes" /></div>
								<p>It all started off first learning to code in high school, Not knowing it was something I would want to do later in life. Only taking the extra class to get to use computers at school. </p>
								<p>Doing only regular jobs after graduating high school was only getting me by. I would jump from one job to another. Just trying to figure out what is it that I wanted to do in life. To do something else with my life I decided to join the Army. This was the first time I wanted to reinvent myself.</p>
								<p>But something was not quite fulfilling about staying in the Army. So I finished my commitment to the Army. Leaving to go back to what I enjoyed and that was tinkering around with computers. I started a career in IT by getting my degree in Network and Security. Fast forward after trying to break into the field. I found it disappointing with my prospects for moving up.</p>
								<p>This was the point I looked at changing direction again by helping out at a food bank. By volunteering my time and giving back to my community. I found that I enjoyed the mission. I even got offered to work at the Food Bank of South Jersey and later became the new Volunteer Coordinator.</p>
								<p>With some time passing in my role. I helped out with the website and learned how to code HTML Emails for marketing. I was enjoying that aspect of the job. That's when life threw me a curveball again. The non-profit ran into funding issues and cut nearly half the workforce. I was one of the unlucky to have my position eliminated overnight and was without a job.</p>
								<p>With my sudden discovery of being jobless for the first time. I looked towards a more stable career by way of government employment. So I applied and passed the USPS exams to become a City Mail Carrier.</p>
								<p>During my career, the pandemic happened and turned everything around. Schools and daycares were closed overnight to only open months later. For my son, I used all my available leave and the new covid relief time to take care of my toddler son. Having extra time in the day. I bounced around from one house project to the next. Then one day a friend from work had some issues with his website for a side business. I decided to help him out and started learning how to code his website. This revealed that this was something I really liked and wanted to learn more about development.</p>
								<p>Before I could rediscover programming again, the schools opened back up and my covid leave ran out. So back at work with Covid, the workload doubled. With the adding stress of covid on top of everything. I sought a more stable environment for my family by leaving New Jersey for Georgia and I took a transfer down as a window clerk.</p>
								<p>It turned out to be a great place in Georgia but the USPS office here was even worse all around compared to New Jersey office. Doing split shifts as a clerk with a long commute left me with too much time. I filled it with podcasts and videos on my phone. Luckily this led back to some coding videos. So I tried my hand again by following along some career paths.</p>
								<p>With everything else, I've done up to this point. I decided to go all in. This time taking it seriously. After some time to understand how to code. Things started to fall into place and I was making project after project.</p>
								<p>This website is a combination of all projects and hard work up to this point. Thank You for learning more about me.</p>
