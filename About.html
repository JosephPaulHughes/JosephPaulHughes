									<h1>My Story</h1>
									<p> With the challenging & yet rewarding path in becoming a self taught programmer. Has given me such great experience and new concepts on overcoming hurdles in life.</p>
									<p> My path to becoming a great Developer has taken grit, passion, & determination I just now realized was in myself to move even a single step forward to my goal.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Main Pic.JPG" alt="Joseph Hughes" /></div>
								<p>After spending time in the work force going from one job to another slightly better job. I decided to join the Army to experience something more. This was the first time to really see what I was made of inside. But something was still missing in my life and could not figure out exactly what piece of the puzzle was needed.</p>
								<p>With my commitment to the Army coming to a finished. My searched for a new career took me into IT. After getting my Degree into Network & Security my job hunt began. Fast forward my time to break into the field was found with disappointment.</p>
								<p>So I looked at helping out other people to give back. In doing so I found out a new form of purpose. Then that turned into working at the Food Bank of South Jersey and becoming the new Volunteer Coordinator. After many experience with working in my role. The non-profit ran into funding issues and was one of many found without a job.</p>
								<p>With my sudden discovery of being jobless for the first time. I looked towards a more stable career by way of a government job. Now with taking and passing USPS exam. I started my new career as a city mail carrier. After sometime the pandemic happened and I took some leave to take care of my toddle son. With added time in the day. A friend from work had some issues with his website. I experimented with programing in High School and decided to help him out with his website. This revealed something inside me I thought was forgotten. A passion was now uncovered, But then schools opened back up and my payed covid leave ran out. So back to work with new added covid load on top.</p>
								<p>I later decided to move out of New Jersey to Georgia and transfer down as a window clerk for a better quality of life. Soon after my new environment turned out to not be so much better as I envisioned. After running back into coding videos on YouTube. I made up my mind to get back into learning how to code again. This time taking it more seriously and not just reading books and watching videos, But this time building real projects. After sometime it finally started to fall into place and I started to really, and I mean really understand programming.</p>
								<p>Now into the present. This site is all of my work that finally taken shape. Thank You in reading my journey on this path i've taken.</p>
