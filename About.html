									<h1>My Story</h1>
									<p> With the challenging and yet rewarding path in becoming a self taught programmer. Has given me such great experience and new concepts on overcoming hurdles in life.</p>
									<p> My path to becoming a great Developer has taken grit, passion, and determination. Looking back I now realized was a key reason to moving closer, Even if a single step forward at a time to my goals.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Main Pic.JPG" alt="Joseph Hughes" /></div>
								<p>After graduating high school, I went into the work force going from one job to another that was slightly better then the last. With time passing I decided to do something more and joined the Army to experience something greater. This was the first time to really see what I was made of. But something was still missing in my life and could not figure out exactly what piece of the puzzle was needed.</p>
								<p>With my commitment to the Army coming to an end. My searched for a new career took me into IT by getting my Degree in Network and Security. Thus another job hunt began. Fast forward trying to break into the field. I was found with disappointment in my prospects.</p>
								<p>This was the point I looked at changing direction by helping out in volunteering my time by giving back to my community. In doing so I found out a new missing piece. This soon turned into working at the Food Bank of South Jersey and becoming the new Volunteer Coordinator. After many years of experience in my role. I thought it was all figured out. Thats when life through me a curve ball again. The non-profit ran into funding issues and was forced to cut nearly half the work force. I was one of the unlucky to have my position eliminated overnight and left without a job.</p>
								<p>With my sudden discovery of being jobless for the first time. I looked towards a more stable career by way of a government job. So I applied and passed passed the USPS exams. Thus beginning my new career as a City Mail Carrier. With sometime passing the pandemic happened. With schools and daycares closing for what looked like months out. I dipped into my leave as well with the covid relief time to take care of my toddle son. With some new added free time in the day. I bounced around from one project to the next. Then one day a friend from work had some issues with his website he used for a side business. I experimented with programing in High School and decided to help him out with his website. This revealed something inside me I thought was forgotten. A passion was now rediscovered, But then schools opened back up and my payed covid leave ran out. So back to work I went. The new added covid load increased the time at work. As well with more added stress on top of everything.</p>
								<p>Seeking a way to get back to a more stable life and environment. My family decided to move out of New Jersey to Georgia and I took a transfer down as a window clerk for a better quality of life. Soon after my new environment turned out to not be so much better as I envisioned.</p>
								<p>To pass the slow days at work. I listened to podcasts and watching videos on my phone. This is when I ran back into coding videos on YouTube. I just had to give it one last try to learn. With my mind made up I leaped back into coding again. This time taking it more seriously and not just reading books and watching videos, But building real projects. After sometime it finally started to fall into place and I started to really, and I mean really understand programming.</p>
								<p>Now into the present. This website is a combination of all my hard work as a self taught programmer that has finally taken shape. Thank You in reading my journey on this path i've taken.</p>
